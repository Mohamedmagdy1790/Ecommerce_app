Can you explain why creating separate copies of the state and country objects was initially necessary?


Certainly! Creating separate copies of the state and country objects using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) was initially done to ensure that any future changes to the original state and country objects would not affect the copied objects within the purchase.shippingAddress and purchase.billingAddress objects.

In JavaScript, objects are assigned by reference. When you assign an object to a new variable or property, the new variable or property points to the same memory location as the original object. This means that any modifications made to the original object will also affect the copied object.

In the given code, purchase.shippingAddress and purchase.billingAddress are assigned the value of this.checkOutFormGroup.controls['shippingAddress'].value and this.checkOutFormGroup.controls['billingAddress'].value, respectively. These values might contain objects for state and country. If the original state or country objects were to change in the future, the objects within purchase.shippingAddress and purchase.billingAddress would also be affected since they are references to the same objects.

To avoid this potential issue and ensure that the copied objects remain independent, the code creates separate copies of the state and country objects using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()). This technique creates a new object with the same properties and values as the original object but stored in a different memory location. As a result, any changes to the original objects would not impact the copied objects.

By creating deep copies of the state and country objects, you can safely modify the copied objects within the purchase.shippingAddress and purchase.billingAddress objects without worrying about unintended side effects caused by changes to the original objects in the future.
